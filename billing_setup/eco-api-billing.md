## Pricing models

Provide ECO offers two pricing models: 
- Fixed rate. This allows the API user to acquire carbon retirements at a pre-determined fixed price set within the last 30 days.
- Spot rate. This determines pricing based on a small premium upon the current available market spot price for carbon offsets.

Pricing models are subject to user's submitted billing details and other factors.

Additional surchages may apply for credit/debit card usage.

## Billing

Unless otherwise specified - invoices are sent to the email used to sign up for the API credentials in Shuttle. Each invoice will also include a usage report summarizing their total carbon retirements for the period specified.

Fixed rate customers are billed automatically through the credit/debit card on file or via Stripe on a monthly basis.

Spot rate customers are offered net 30 payment terms and can pay by wire transfer, check, ACH or other supported methods.


## On blockchain usage
While cryptocurrencies are used to pay gas fees and acquire/retire carbon, individual ECO API users are never required to hold any digital assets. A technique known as account abstraction enables the ECO API to pay fees on the user's behalf. This enables the ECO to conduct transcations and monitor usage for billing.
